<h2>Trees are amazing! What’s more, they are an amazing tool for solving many of our most pressing environmental problems.</h2>
<p>Trees soak up carbon dioxide when they grow, reducing the amount of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere and 
   slowing climate change. Restoring degraded forests creates habitat for many species, including endangered ones.
   By filtering stormwater runoff and pollutants, forests reduce flood risk and protect the health of our waterways.
   Trees prevent wind and water erosion, influence local weather patterns, keep us healthy and happy, and produce many
    products that are essential to our daily lives.</p>

 <h2>Despite the benefits of forest ecosystems, deforestation and its contribution to climate change and species loss
     remains a significant problem in many parts of the world. </h2>  
 <p>In addition to fighting forest destruction, planting trees and restoring forest ecosystems are some of the most
    important and cost-effective solutions to these twin crises. A staggering 12 percent of human-caused carbon dioxide
    emissions come from deforestation but, if we halted this destruction and planted trees, we could instead pull 
    a massive amount of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and reduce our climate impact.</p>    

 <hr>
 <h2>Fortunately, there have been huge strides made in reforestation in many places.</h2> 
 <p>in Africa, a deforestation hotspot, projects like Kenya’s Green Belt Initiative are making headway against the 
    destruction by planting forests for firewood, ecosystem restoration, and climate resilience. South Korea has managed 
    to reforest two-thirds of its land area since the end of the Korean War, and many other places such as Brazil,
    the United States, China, and Russia have been planting trees as well. The worldwide reforestation movement is
    gaining steam at a time where it has never been more necessary for the health of our planet and its people!</p>

 <h2>The kind of trees planted makes a huge difference in the climate and biodiversity impacts of reforestation.</h2>   
 <p>Trees are planted for many reasons: to restore degraded ecosystems, for wind or flood protection,
    for timber production, for agroforestry (the production of agricultural products from trees), and 
    for other purposes. Native forests store a lot of carbon, both in the biomass of the trees themselves and in the soil.
    They also support high levels of biodiversity. Agroforestry can sometimes have dual economic and environmental benefits,
    but the carbon storage potential is often lower than native forests and the habitat much less ideal for native wildlife.
    Timber plantations store carbon as well and can reduce logging pressure on native forests. However, lower wood prices created by
    timber plantations could shift deforestation to tropical primary forests where logging is cheap. Of course, there is always
    the risk that plantation forests or agroforestry operations could destroy and replace natural forests due to their higher
    potential for profit.</p>

<p>Poorly-designed tree planting efforts can have few positive impacts, and can even backfire: take Chile’s long-running
    tree planting subsidy policy. By indiscriminately subsidizing tree planting (and not policing native forest clearance),
    the country unintentionally encouraged logging companies to cut down its biodiverse native forests and replace them with timber
    plantations. In contrast, well-designed, ecologically sensitive tree planting efforts avoid tend to avoid negative environmental
    impacts while delivering much greater benefits.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center; "><strong><u> What can you do?</u></strong> </h1>    

<h2>1. Plant trees in your yard or property.</h2>
<p>In addition to storing carbon and welcoming birds and other species, trees can provide shade, places to hang a hammock,
    and ample climbing opportunities for people of all ages. Your local wildlife (and your kids!) will thank you for the place
    to play. If your neighborhood has a homeowners association, check with them about landscaping restrictions before planting.</p>

<h2>2. Encourage your neighbors to plant trees.</h2>
<p>The more trees in your neighborhood, the better for everyone!</p> 

<h2>3. Volunteer with local organizations that plant trees and restore degraded ecosystems.</h2>
<P>Land trusts conserve land and often need volunteers to help restore and maintain healthy forests on their land.
    Look for organizations in your area that plant trees and advocate for urban forests and parks.</P>

<h2>4. Donate to tree-planting efforts around the world.</h2>    
<p>Find projects that restore native forests rather than plant trees destined for logging, and make sure that the promises
    made by the organization you donate to will be kept.</p>
