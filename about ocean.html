<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>ECOSYSTEMS POLLUTION</u></strong></h1>
 <p>Plastic pollution causes a threat to marine ecosystems. Species, both plants and animals,
    adapt to their environment. A new natural balance is created time and time again. Plastic
    in the environment upsets that balance. Plastic pollution has arisen in just a few decades
    and is increasing rapidly. Animal species simply haven’t had the chance to learn how to deal
    with it, for example by avoiding plastic or by living on it. A species may also be more vulnerable
    to plastic than another, which disrupts their interdependence.</p>

<h3>ECOSYSTEMS POLLUTION: THE CASE OF THE PERIWINKLE</h3>
<p>The common periwinkle, a sea snail, is on the menu of the crab. Normally the periwinkles defend themselves
    by withdrawing into their shell as soon as they detect the presence of a crab. Research has now shown that
    this defence mechanism is impaired or no longer works because of toxic substances from microplastics, due to
    the pollution of its ecosystem. The chemical substances that bind with plastic in seawater, or that leak out
    of the plastic, paralyze the defence mechanism of the periwinkle. This means that attacking crabs can no longer
    be detected in time.</p>

<h3>MUSSELS AND THREATENED ECOSYSTEMS</h3>
<p>Another study into the threats on marine ecosystems looks at the threads of mussels. Mussels attach themselves
    to the ground, rock or rope, using thin threads. These byssal threads are exceptionally strong and elastic and
    can withstand currents and waves. The mussels are also attached to each other with these threads, creating mussel
    beds. Mussel beds are of great ecological importance. Blue mussels that had been exposed to polyethylene microplastics
    for almost two months lost their grip. In fact, the strength of their byssal threads decreased by half. These exposed
    mussels also produced significantly fewer threads. When, as a result, the mussels are washed away, it has a negative
    effect on the biodiversity of the beds and causes a threat to the marine ecosystem.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Plastic in food chain</u></strong></h1>

<div>

</div>

<p>Plastic has already entered the food chain. Animals carry microplastics in their bodies. When they are themselves eaten,
    those microplastics are also ingested. This process is called ‘trophic transfer’ of microplastics. Since one animal eats
    another, microplastics can move through the food chain. The main question is what happens to the toxins and chemicals that
    are associated with these plastics.</p>

<hr>    

<h3>PLASTIC IN THE FOOD CHAIN AND BIO-ACCUMULATION OF POLLUTANTS</h3>
<p>When plastic ends up in the environment, it tends to bind with environmental pollutants.
    With plastic that moves through the food chain, the attached toxins can also move and accumulate in animal
    fat and tissue through a process called bio-accumulation. In addition, chemicals are often added to plastic
    during the production process, to give them some desired properties. These chemicals can in turn leak from the plastic,
    even when that plastic is inside the body of an animal.</p>

<hr>
<h3>TOXINS SHARED IN THE FOOD CHAIN</h3>

<p>Plastic is by no means the only way that toxins, such as PCBs and dioxins, end up in the food chain.
    The role of plastic in bioaccumulation of toxins is quite small compared to exposure via the animals’ normal food.
    Animals that excrete swallowed plastic may actually cleanse their bodies because toxins present in the body have attached
    themselves to the plastic.</p>
<P>It is a different story for plastic additives. Unlike PCBs and dioxins, these substances have not accumulated in the food
    chain over the decades. When Japanese researchers found a particular flame retardant in the tissues of seabirds, it was 
    certain that it came from swallowed plastic to which the flame retardant was once added. </P>
<hr>
<h3>NUMBER OF ANIMALS AFFECTED BY PLASTIC</h3>

<p>The number of individual animals affected by plastic would be very difficult to estimate but would run into the billions.
    Attempts have been made to determine the number of species affected. In 2015, Dutch researchers found that the number of
    marine species that swallow or get caught in plastic had doubled since 1997: from 267 to 557. This number is now above
    2000, with the caveat that only a very limited number of animal species have been investigated. It is even more difficult
    to determine whether plastic threatens the survival of a certain species, let alone the influence of plastic on the food 
    chain.</p>

<h3>ARROW WORMS</h3>
<p>Arrow worms are transparent torpedo-shaped creatures which live in the sea and hunt for zooplankton.</p>
<P>As has been recorded on film, arrow worms consume plastic microfibers. The digestive tract of this animal 
    is as long as its body. The curled fiber blocks the tube, with the result that the intake of real food is blocked.
    This recording shows how plastic enters the food chain because arrow worms are in turn eaten by animals higher up
    the chain. Amphipods that live at the deepest point of the ocean, the eleven-kilometer-deep Mariana Trench, were 
    examined for the presence of plastic. These animals all had plastic in their bodies, almost always microfibers
    from synthetic clothing.</P>

<h3>PLASTIC IN FISH AND BEHAVIOURAL CHANGES</h3> 
<p>Swedish scientists have shown that nanoplastics can enter the brains of fish through the food chain and lead to abnormal
    behavior. Nanoplastics in algae are eaten by water fleas, which in turn are food for fish. This is how plastic particles
    move through the food chain. The researchers made simulations of the food chain, with and without nanoplastics. In contrast
    to the fish that were not fed nanoplastics, the fish that did eat them showed abnormal behavior: slower eating and hyperactive
    behavior. It was a laboratory study, but the accumulation of plastic in living organs can also take place in nature,
    especially if the animals live for a long time. Fish that swim slower are easy prey. In this way, plastic can disrupt
    the natural balance. </p>

<p>Animals often eat plastic because they are not always able to distinguish plastic from food.
    Organisms that are filter feeders (plankton, shellfish, baleen whales) or that live under the beach sand
    (lugworms) cannot make that distinction. Some fish eat plastic because they mistake it for fish eggs and bite
    at floating plastic in the water. Turtles see plastic bags as the jellyfish that are usually on their menu.
    In the stomachs of the northern fulmar  which gathers its food by flying with an open beak above the 
    water surface  plastic is almost always found. Many grazing animals on land also eat plastic. Plastic debris coated with
    food waste increases the chance that the plastic will be eaten.</p>
<hr>    

<h3>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ANIMALS EAT PLASTIC</h3>
<p>Animals that accidentally eat plastic suffer and often die as a result of it. Swallowed plastic fills the stomach 
    and not surprisingly this reduces the feeling of hunger. Animals eat less, obtain less energy, and weaken. Larger
    pieces of plastic can also block their gastrointestinal tract so that the plastic can no longer be excreted. In other
    cases, plastic is ground into small pieces in the stomach and then scattered everywhere. In this way, the northern fulmar
    grinds and spreads millions of pieces every year. Some of it is left at abandoned nesting sites.</p>

<hr>
<h3>SHOCKING NUMBERS OF ANIMALS WITH PLASTIC IN THE STOMACH</h3>
<p>Fish eat plastic. Turtles eat plastic bags. Even whales have been found dead with tons of plastic in the stomach.
    The stomach contents of the northern fulmar, according to long-term Dutch research, consist of an average of twenty-five
    pieces of plastic. A sperm whale that washed up at the Wakatobi National Park in Indonesia in December 2018
    had 115 cups, 25 bags, four bottles and two slippers in its stomach. More than a thousand pieces of plastic
    were counted in the whale’s stomach and the total weight of plastic was six kilos. In the United Arab Emirates,
    plastic causes half of all camel deaths. The animals eat garbage and lumps of plastic of between ten and sixty
    kilos have been found in their stomachs. Because the plastic cannot pass out of the stomach, the lump continues
    to grow until the animal dies of starvation. In July 2010, a young green turtle washed ashore, heavily weakened, on
    the coast of Brazil near Florianópolis and died a few hours later. This specimen had 3267 pieces of plastic in its gut
    and another 308 pieces in its stomach. Only pieces of plastic larger than 5 mm were counted. </p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>ANIMALS STUCK IN PLASTIC</u></strong></h1>

<div>
<img src="img/animal stuck in plastic.jpg" width="400px" height="300px"    alt="" title="">

</div>


<p>Animals from many species are known to die from plastic. That number is now more than 2000 species and is constantly increasing.
    This includes animals that become stuck in plastic. When this happens, animals can no longer move freely; they choke, starve,
    or lose limbs due to amputation. This figure does not reflect the actual number of species of animals affected by plastic,
    but only the species that have been investigated. If we ask which animal species are demonstrably not affected, the answer
    would be: shockingly few.</p>

<hr>

<h3>ANIMALS STUCK IN PLASTIC LEAD TO AMPUTATION</h3>

<p>Getting stuck in plastic can have horrible consequences for the animals such as reduced mobility, starvation, drowning or
    suffocation. It can lead to infections, growths or amputation of limbs. Animals stuck in plastic become less capable of finding
    food and become also easy victims for predators. For whales, entanglement in plastic is a greater threat than whaling. The sharp
    threads of nets can cut into their flesh, causing whales to lose fins or tails. Other whales must swim with the fishing nets
    in which they are entangled. Marine mammals such as sea lions, dolphins, and seals are regularly the victims of their own
    curiosity, and turtles are known for getting easily stuck in plastic too. They swim right up to plastic objects and
    play with them. These species have not yet learned that these objects are not fun but dangerous.</p>

<hr>

<h3>ENTANGLED BY BALLOONS</h3>

<p>Birds can become entangled in the plastic derived from balloons which can wrap around their legs or head. It is indeed a
    festive sight to release balloons, especially large masses of balloons. But it is horrible to see birds wearing balloon
    ribbons around their neck. After their flight, balloons do come down somewhere. If that is at the sea, there is a chance
    that they wash up on land, and animals get stuck in the plastic ribbons. A lot of balloon remnants are always found on beaches.
    The Plastic Soup Foundation and other environmental organizations have been running the campaign Die ballon gaat niet op
    (The Balloons don’t go up) for years, aiming to discourage and prohibit the release of balloons.  In the Netherlands,
    more and more municipalities prohibit the release of balloons. Also, the organization which oversees the annual King’s Day
    celebrations, the Koninklijke Bond van Oranjeverenigingen, now also discourages the practice.</p>
